                <p>This design is fucking brilliant. You are not your fucking work. Fuck. Think about all the fucking possibilities. Sometimes it is appropriate to place various typographic elements on the outside of the fucking left margin of text to maintain a strong vertical axis. This practice is referred to as exdenting and is most often used with bullets and quotations. You won’t get good at anything by doing it a lot fucking aimlessly. Widows and orphans are terrible fucking tragedies, both in real life and definitely in typography. If you’re not being fucking honest with yourself how could you ever hope to communicate something meaningful to someone else? Design as if your fucking life depended on it. Must-do is a good fucking master. Why are you fucking reading all of this? Get back to work. Never, never assume that what you have achieved is fucking good enough. Creativity is a fucking work-ethic. Paul Rand once said, “The public is more familiar with bad fucking design than good design. It is, in effect, conditioned to prefer bad design, because that is what it lives with. The new becomes threatening, the old reassuring.” The graphic designer’s first fucking consideration is always the size</p>
